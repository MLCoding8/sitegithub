My name is Malcolm Lopez. I was born and raised in Austin, TX and currently live in San Antonio. I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at UTSA with a forte in rigorous analysis and creative problem-solving. My path into engineering started with my appreciation for math and the satisfaction of intuitively solving problems. My approach to problem solving is maintaining accurate documentation throughout the process and eliminating any ambiguities in logic. I believe good design is invisible; while poor design becomes evident when something doesn't work. I'm currently seeking a Summer 2026 internship where I can contribute to impactful engineering pursuits.
